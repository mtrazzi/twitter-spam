1)  you'll need to [setup t]((https://github.com/sferik/t), which means creating a Twitter developer account etc.

2) when that's done, just launch ```./thread```

- it will prompt you for the first tweet of the thread

- then you need to type `N_CHAR` every `N_SEC` or you lose. tweets are automatically sent when you reach N_CHAR.
