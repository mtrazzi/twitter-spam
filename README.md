1) you'll need a [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)

2) to [install stuff](https://github.com/sferik/t)

3) but then just run ```./spam```,

4) write the first tweet of the thread (or insert the twitter id of 1st tweet (can be found here: https://twitter.com/YOUR_USERNAME/status/TWEET_ID)).

5) and you're ready to type `N_CHAR` every `N_SEC` until you lose. tweets are automatically sent when you reach `N_CHAR`
